- Step 1: Ask your administrator to resend the credentials.

- Step 2: When logging in, do not enter your email and password.

- Step 3: Select “activate your account here”

    <div className="doc-image-container"> <img src={require('./img/autenticador.jpg').default} alt="Authenticator setup preview" className="doc-image doc-image-small" /> </div> 
    Note: If nothing happens when selecting this option, clear your browser’s cache (at least 7 days) and try again.
