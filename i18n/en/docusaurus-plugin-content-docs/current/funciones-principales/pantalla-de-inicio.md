  This graph visually represents the behavior of the viewers, also in the period selected by the calendar. The first box on the left indicates the period that has been selected, for this example it is a period of 30 days. The second box shows the total number of viewers we have had in that period, the graph represents that in 30 days we have had 7,212 viewers. The third box averages the number of viewers per day, this means that it divides the number of viewers in total by the number of days in the period (7,212/30=240.4) in case of obtaining numbers with decimals, the corresponding rounding will be done to show closed amounts. Finally, the fourth box shows the maximum number of viewers that was obtained in a day, in this example 741 are shown, therefore, we can conclude that on August 22 we had the highest number of viewers in the 30-day period, to know the indicated date, in case of not visualizing it at the bottom of the graph, passing the cursor over the highest bar will give us more information.
