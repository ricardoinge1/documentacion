## Password and Reset Policy

Account security is a shared responsibility. The system implements robust measures to protect information, and administrators manage access.

> Account and password management is the responsibility of the system's administrator team. If a user forgets their password, they must ask the administrator to reset their credentials. They will receive an email to carry out the process, similar to the first login.

### Security Principle: Zero Knowledge

The protection of credentials is our top priority. For this reason, the system adheres to a strict security policy.

> Passwords are securely protected within the system, so it is not possible to view or retrieve them in plain text. They can only be reset through the credential recovery procedure.

This means that **no one**, not even the system administrators or the Elenix team, can see your current password. Only you know it.

## Password Reset Flow

If a user cannot access their account, the process to regain access is as follows:

**Step 1: User Request**

> The user must contact their designated account administrator within their own company and request a password reset.
> **Step 2: Recovery Email**
> The system will automatically send an email to the user's registered address. This email contains a unique and time-limited link to continue the process.
> **Step 3: Creating the New Password**
> The user must click the link in the email, which will redirect them to a secure page where they can set their new password. Once confirmed, they can log in with their new credentials.

:::tip Didn't receive the email?
If more than 5 minutes have passed and you haven't received the email, check your "Junk" or "Spam" folder. If you still can't find it, contact your administrator again to verify that your registered email address in the system is correct.

## Security Best Practices

- **Do not share:** Never share your password with anyone. Support staff or administrators will never ask for it.
- **Complexity:** Create passwords that combine uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Length:** A longer password is a stronger password. Aim for a minimum of 12 characters.
