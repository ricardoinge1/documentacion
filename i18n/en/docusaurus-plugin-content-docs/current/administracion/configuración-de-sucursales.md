## üîÑ Bulk Upload Onboarding Process

The primary method for registering new branches is through a bulk upload managed by our team. This ensures data integrity and consistency from the very beginning.

> The incorporation of branches into the system is carried out through a bulk information upload process, coordinated by the Elenix team. For this purpose, the team provides a standardized template, which contains the structure and required fields for branch registration. This template is given to the account administrator, who is responsible for completing it with the corresponding information and submitting it to the Elenix team for validation and upload into the system.

### Detailed Workflow

The process can be broken down into the following steps:

1.  **Request the Template:** The account administrator must contact the Elenix support team to request the branch upload template.
2.  **Complete the Template:** The administrator is responsible for filling out the file with the data for all locations to be registered.
3.  **Submit for Validation:** Once complete, the file is sent back to the Elenix team. Our technical team will perform a validation to ensure that the format is correct and that all mandatory data is present.
4.  **Upload and Notification:** If the validation is successful, the branches are uploaded to the system. The Elenix team will notify the administrator once the process is finished and the branches are visible on the platform. In case of an error, you will be notified so you can correct the information.

:::danger Attention!
To ensure the success of the process, it is vitally important **not to modify the structure of the provided template**. Do not change the column names, delete columns, or alter their order. Any change to the structure will result in a failed upload.

## üìâ Modifying and Deleting Branches

Just like with onboarding, any modification to an existing branch's data or the need to delete it from the system must be managed through a request to the Elenix team.
