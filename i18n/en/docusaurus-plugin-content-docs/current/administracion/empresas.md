:::info Companies
As the name suggests, this represents the organization or company to which users belong. Each user is assigned to a company to identify which organization they work for and to manage access, information, and resources associated with that company.

## Why is Management Centralized?

The decision for the Elenix team to be solely responsible for creating and managing companies is based on several key principles for system integrity and security:

1.  **Data Consistency:** This prevents the creation of duplicate companies or those with typographical errors, ensuring the database remains clean and reliable.
2.  **Correct Initial Setup:** Each company may require a specific configuration (modules, base permissions, etc.). The Elenix team ensures that each new company is set up correctly from the start.
3.  **Security:** Centralizing the management of such important entities prevents unauthorized changes that could compromise the security or access to an organization's data.

### Process for Requesting a New Company

If you need to register a new organization in the system, you must contact the Elenix support team. Our team will request the necessary information and perform the initial setup for you.
